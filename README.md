# hello-world
A practice thingy 

Hello friends, I'm very, very, VERY new to coding and using this to learn about how to, you know, code. 
I also want to use this as a Digital Humanities sandbox. 
<b>I'm working on remembering how to do this.</b> 
<body> So I think this is how this works 
But honestly I'm not entirely sure
So I'll give it a shot </body>
